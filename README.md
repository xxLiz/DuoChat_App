DuoChat App is a streamlined, intuitive messaging solution designed for seamless communication between two users.

Developed in C, using the POSIX threading library (pthread) for multithreading and libraries like stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h for basic functionality.

Networking relies on sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h, and arpa/inet.h for socket management and network communication

A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) is needed, with tools like Make or CMake for managing builds and dependencies.
